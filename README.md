# Assignment1:

* ### Question1: 
       * Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.

* ### Question2: 
      * Given the head of a linked list and an integer val,
        remove all the nodes of the linked list that has Node.val == val, and return the new head.

* ### Question3: 
      * You are given the head of a linked list, and an integer k.
        Return the head of the linked list after swapping the values of the kth node
        from the beginning and the kth node from the end (the list is 1-indexed).

* ### Question4:
      *  Given the head of a singly linked list and an integer k, split the linked list into k consecutive linked list parts.
         The length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should have a size differing by more than one. This may lead to some parts being null.
         The parts should be in the order of occurrence in the input list, and parts occurring earlier should always have a size greater than
         or equal to parts occurring later. Return an array of the k parts.

* ### Question5: 
      * Given a Circular Linked List node, which is sorted in non-descending order, write a function to insert a value insertVal into the list
        such that it remains a sorted circular list. The given node can be a reference to any single node in the list and may not necessarily be the
        smallest value in the circular list. If there are multiple suitable places for insertion, you may choose any place to insert the new value.
        After the insertion, the circular list should remain sorted. If the list is empty (i.e., the given node is null),
        you should create a new single circular list and return the reference to that single node. Otherwise, you should return the originally given node.
